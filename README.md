# Project Specifications

This specification incorporates Redis as a cache layer to enhance the performance and scalability of your real-time sentiment analysis service.

Tools:

Backend: FastAPI (Python)
Database: PostgreSQL
Message Queue: RabbitMQ
Workflow Orchestration: Apache Airflow
Reverse Proxy: Traefik
API Frameworks: REST API (using FastAPI) & GraphQL
Cache: Redis
Data Pipeline:

Data Ingestion:

Users submit text data or a script streams data as before.
Sentiment Analysis with Caching:

Before processing messages from RabbitMQ, worker tasks check the Redis cache for the specific text data.
If the sentiment analysis for the data already exists in the cache, the result is retrieved and returned directly, reducing database load and improving response times.
If the data is not found in the cache, sentiment analysis is performed using libraries like NLTK or TextBlob, and the result is stored in both the PostgreSQL database and the Redis cache for future requests.
API Endpoints:

REST and GraphQL APIs function as described previously.
When retrieving results, the API checks the Redis cache first before querying the database, further enhancing performance.
Benefits of using Redis:

Improved Response Times: Frequently accessed sentiment analysis results are readily available in memory, reducing database load and speeding up responses.
Reduced Database Load: Caching lowers the number of database queries, improving overall system performance and scalability.
Data Consistency: Implement cache invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency between Redis and PostgreSQL.
Additional Considerations:

Cache Invalidation: Update the cache whenever the corresponding data in the database changes to maintain consistency. Explore eviction policies to manage cache size effectively.
Cache Key Design: Design meaningful and efficient cache keys to optimize cache utilization and retrieval speed.
Optional Tools:

Frontend application
Streaming Analytics frameworks
Machine Learning models
This enhanced architecture provides a more performant and scalable solution for real-time sentiment analysis. By leveraging Redis caching, you can significantly improve response times and handle larger data volumes efficiently.
